# GettingandCleaningDataProject
The two files (Codebook and run_analysis.R) in this repository provide information about the data and how the data was organized in R to create a tidy dataset. R code The codes for manipulating data in R were written in version 3.3.0. The rearranging of the data required the use of following packages: dplyr, tidyr and data.table. There are 4 major manipulations needed to arrange the data: (a) sorting the files, renaming the double purpose row/column “v1” to a single variable in both the subject and activity files; (b) creating tables for consistence in order to merge files by data type; (c) merging the data sets and adding features to create a complete dataframe; (d) manipulating the data frame to extract the mean and standard deviation measurements and transforming the dataframe into tidy data frame with complete descriptive names. Code Book The code book describes the data. It walks the reader through the logical steps of identifying critical files, variables to showing how the codes were changing the outputs data on each question.
